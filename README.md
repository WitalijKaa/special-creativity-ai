# SPECIAL CREATIVITY is an engine for my hobby â€” writing science fiction in a very specific genre.

I have created a calculator + accounting notebook to track lives and events of personages of my book. Its a very simple project, but it has good code examples and integration with LLM that u can run on local PC. Very personal stuff in the fact.
